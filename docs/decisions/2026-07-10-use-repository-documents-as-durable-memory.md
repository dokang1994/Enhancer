# 2026-07-10: Use Repository Documents As Durable Memory

Status: Accepted Decision

Decision:

Enhancer will use repository documents as the durable memory for future ChatGPT and Codex sessions.

Rationale:

Conversation memory is unreliable across sessions. Repository files can be read, reviewed, committed, and treated as the single source of truth.

Consequences:

- Agents must read the required documents at session start.
- `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` must be updated at session close.
- Proposals must not be treated as accepted decisions until recorded here.
