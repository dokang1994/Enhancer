# Decision Log

## Accepted Decisions

### 2026-07-14: Use A Repository Gradle Wrapper

Status: Accepted Decision

Decision:

Enhancer will store a Gradle Wrapper in the repository and use Java 17 as the build runtime. A global Gradle installation is not required for normal project builds.

Rationale:

The Wrapper makes local development and future CI reproducible while matching the existing Java 17 Gradle build. It also removes reliance on user-specific cached Gradle paths.

Consequences:

- Developers run `gradlew.bat` on Windows or `./gradlew` on Unix-like systems.
- Wrapper scripts, properties, and the wrapper JAR are version-controlled.
- Java 17 remains an external prerequisite and is not committed to the repository.

### 2026-07-14: Adopt Verified Skill And Evidence Operating Rules

Status: Accepted Decision

Decision:

Enhancer will adopt repository-defined Skill authoring rules, memory distillation, test-first behavior for observable feature and bug-fix changes, and fresh verification evidence before completion claims. The initial Skill catalog remains explicitly proposed until corresponding `SKILL.md` files exist. Task cycles do not force commits; commits remain controlled by repository policy and user instruction.

Rationale:

These rules strengthen repeatability and verification while preserving Document Driven Development, least privilege, proposal-state separation, and the existing human approval boundary for Git operations.

Consequences:

- RFC-0002, RFC-0005, RFC-0007, RFC-0008, and RFC-0009 describe the accepted direction.
- `.ai/skill_rules.md` defines operational authoring constraints for future Skills.
- Proposed catalog entries cannot be treated as installed or available Skills.
- `allowed-tools` uses a small documented permission vocabulary rather than undeclared tool names.
- Actual Skill workflows, loading, and runtime enforcement remain future tasks.

### 2026-07-12: Start Planner With Deterministic Repository Proposals

Status: Accepted Decision

Decision:

The first Planner consumes `ProjectContext`, blocks proposals while `CURRENT_TASK.md` is active, and otherwise proposes the first ready roadmap phase. Its output has explicit `PROPOSAL` state and structured reason, scope, acceptance criteria, out-of-scope items, and risks.

Rationale:

This reaches the first self-hosting planning behavior without introducing an LLM, hidden chat context, document mutation, or premature ranking logic.

Consequences:

- Planner behavior is deterministic and unit-testable.
- A proposal cannot be confused with an accepted decision.
- Natural-language planning, proposal ranking, persistence, and execution remain future work.

### 2026-07-12: Implement Context Reader As A Single Java Module

Status: Accepted Decision

Decision:

The first Repository Context Reader is implemented in a single Gradle Java 17 project under `com.enhancer.context`. The required document order is represented by an enum, and the returned context uses immutable records.

Rationale:

This matches the existing architecture guide and provides a stable structured input for future planning without premature modules, Spring wiring, or domain abstractions.

Consequences:

- Required startup documents have one canonical code-level order.
- Missing documents fail with a checked exception that identifies the path.
- Future context sources can build on `ProjectContext` without changing this task into a full Context Builder.

### 2026-07-10: Manage Major Designs As RFCs

Status: Accepted Decision

Decision:

Enhancer will manage major design areas as RFC-style Markdown documents under `docs/rfcs/`, starting with RFC-0001 through RFC-0012.

Rationale:

The project is large enough that design topics need stable identifiers, reviewable history, and clear references. RFC-style documents make long-term architecture easier to maintain across multiple AI agents and sessions.

Consequences:

- Major architecture changes should add or update an RFC.
- Accepted direction should still be summarized in `DECISION_LOG.md`.
- RFC statuses distinguish Draft, Accepted, Implemented, and Superseded.
- The initial RFC track covers Constitution, AI Behavior, Prompt Contract, Context Builder, Planner, Tool, Skill, Memory, Multi-Agent, AI Operating System, Plugin SDK, and Self Improvement.

### 2026-07-10: Adopt Six-Month AI Development OS Roadmap

Status: Accepted Decision

Decision:

Enhancer will use a six-month open-source roadmap that evolves from Constitution, Architecture, Context, Agent Loop, and Tool toward Planner, Skill, Memory, Prompt Engine, MCP, Plugin, Git, Terminal, VSCode Extension, CLI, Dashboard, Multi-Agent, Scheduler, Background Agent, Self Improvement, Plugin SDK, and Open Source Release.

Rationale:

The target is larger than a 30-day prototype. A six-month roadmap gives the project realistic phases while keeping the 30-day self-hosting milestone as the first checkpoint.

Consequences:

- The 30-day goal remains the first self-hosting milestone.
- Long-term architecture is tracked separately from immediate implementation tasks.
- Work remains Sprint-based and document-driven.

### 2026-07-10: Read `.ai/` Before Every AI Work Session

Status: Accepted Decision

Decision:

Every AI agent should read the `.ai/` folder before starting work. The folder contains AI-only operational documents: `constitution.md`, `workflow.md`, `coding_rules.md`, `architecture.md`, `prompt_rules.md`, and `memory.md`.

Rationale:

The root documents are canonical, but `.ai/` gives agents a compact operational entry point. This allows the user to say "항상 .ai 폴더를 읽고 시작해" and have a consistent startup rule across Codex, Claude, GPT, and future Enhancer agents.

Consequences:

- `prompts/SESSION_START.md` includes `.ai/` in the required reading order.
- `AGENTS.md` requires agents to read `.ai/` before work.
- `.ai/` must mirror operational rules without replacing root canonical documents.

### 2026-07-10: Treat Docs As A Multi-Agent Prompt Book

Status: Accepted Decision

Decision:

Each major `docs/` chapter will end with a `Prompt Book` section containing separate prompts for Codex, Claude, and GPT.

Rationale:

Enhancer is developed by multiple AI agents with different strengths. A shared chapter can guide all agents, but each agent needs role-specific instructions to reduce ambiguity.

Consequences:

- Codex prompts focus on implementation and verification.
- Claude prompts focus on architecture and risk review.
- GPT prompts focus on explanation, task framing, and session continuity.
- New chapter documents should include all three prompt types.

### 2026-07-10: Use Explicit Session Resume Protocol

Status: Accepted Decision

Decision:

New ChatGPT sessions must be resumed by providing the core repository documents, because ChatGPT cannot automatically read the user's local Enhancer repository across sessions.

Rationale:

The project depends on repository-backed memory. Without an explicit resume protocol, a new session may rely on incomplete chat memory and drift away from the source of truth.

Consequences:

- `prompts/CHATGPT_SESSION_RESUME.md` defines the required upload/paste workflow.
- `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` must remain complete enough to recover short-term state.
- Documents override chat history when conflicts occur.
- The human owner controls final approval and push.

### 2026-07-10: Operate Enhancer As A Real Open Source Project

Status: Accepted Decision

Decision:

Enhancer will be operated as a real open source project, not as a one-off chat artifact or documentation-only repository. The project will include documentation, code, ADRs, tests, examples, and shared prompts for Codex, Claude, and GPT.

Rationale:

The expected scope is too large for a single chat session. A Git-managed, chapter-based, reviewed workflow allows the project to grow over months without losing architectural consistency.

Consequences:

- Work proceeds by Sprint and small tasks.
- Documentation and code evolve together.
- ADR review is required for meaningful design changes.
- AI roles are explicit: Codex implements; ChatGPT supports architecture, backend design, agent research, documentation, and review.
- Git repository documents remain the source of truth.

### 2026-07-10: Use Codex-Ready Chapter Documents

Status: Accepted Decision

Decision:

Enhancer will maintain feature documents under `docs/` as Codex-ready prompts. Each document should describe the goal, architecture, task boundary, tests, and out-of-scope items for a major platform capability.

Rationale:

The project is too large to drive from chat history. Chapter-based Markdown specifications allow Codex, Claude, GPT, and future Enhancer agents to implement one slice at a time from repository state.

Consequences:

- `docs/` is part of the operating system for development, not passive documentation.
- New major capabilities should receive a prompt-style specification before implementation.
- Implementation should proceed sprint by sprint rather than attempting a full Cursor-like platform at once.

### 2026-07-10: Use Document Driven Development

Status: Accepted Decision

Decision:

Enhancer will follow Document Driven Development. New work must move through Constitution, Architecture, ADR / Decision Log, Task, Implementation, Test, and Documentation Update before it is considered complete.

Rationale:

Enhancer depends on repository documents as durable memory. If code changes happen before architecture, decisions, and tasks are clarified, future AI sessions will lose the reason behind the implementation.

Consequences:

- Agents must not jump directly from idea to code.
- Important architectural changes must be recorded before or during implementation.
- `CURRENT_TASK.md` remains the scope boundary for implementation.
- Documentation update is part of Definition of Done.

### 2026-07-10: Build Enhancer As A Self-Hosting AI Development OS

Status: Accepted Decision

Decision:

Enhancer is not a Cursor clone. Enhancer is a self-hosting AI Development Operating System that should eventually read its own repository context, understand project state, propose the next task, and assist its own development.

Rationale:

The project goal is not to copy Cursor's interface or behavior. The goal is to build a durable framework where AI agents can resume work from repository state and eventually help operate the project themselves.

Consequences:

- The first product slice should prioritize context reading and task planning over UI polish.
- Repository documents are product inputs, not only project management artifacts.
- The 30-day milestone is for Enhancer to propose next tasks from repository context.

### 2026-07-10: Use Repository Documents As Durable Memory

Status: Accepted Decision

Decision:

Enhancer will use repository documents as the durable memory for future ChatGPT and Codex sessions.

Rationale:

Conversation memory is unreliable across sessions. Repository files can be read, reviewed, committed, and treated as the single source of truth.

Consequences:

- Agents must read the required documents at session start.
- `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` must be updated at session close.
- Proposals must not be treated as accepted decisions until recorded here.

## Proposals

- Define the product scope for Enhancer.
- Choose the initial implementation stack.
