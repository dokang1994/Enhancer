# 2026-07-10: Use Explicit Session Resume Protocol

Status: Accepted Decision

Decision:

New ChatGPT sessions must be resumed by providing the core repository documents, because ChatGPT cannot automatically read the user's local Enhancer repository across sessions.

Rationale:

The project depends on repository-backed memory. Without an explicit resume protocol, a new session may rely on incomplete chat memory and drift away from the source of truth.

Consequences:

- `prompts/CHATGPT_SESSION_RESUME.md` defines the required upload/paste workflow.
- `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` must remain complete enough to recover short-term state.
- Documents override chat history when conflicts occur.
- The human owner controls final approval and push.
